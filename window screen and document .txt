Read about the difference between window, screen and document in javascript

Window: 
Each browser tab has its own top-level window object.    
Each <iframe> (and deprecated <frame>) element has its own window object too,
nested within a parent window. Each of these windows gets  its own separate global object.
window.window always refers to window,but window.parent and window.top might refer to enclosing windows,
giving access to other execution contexts.n addition to document and screen described below, 
window properties include

setTimeout() and setInterval() binding event handlers to a timer
location giving the current URL
history with methods back() and forward() giving the tab's mutable history
navigator describing the browser software

Document:

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves
as an entry point into the web page’s content, which is the DOM tree.
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object.
It is the root node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the
window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
HTML documents, served with the “text/html” content type, also implement the HTML 
Document interface, whereas XML and SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.

Screen:

Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions .
 It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. 
 It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without
  window prefix.

Properties:

screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
screen.pixelDepth
